			<h1>Cyclometer Project - Requirements Analysis</h1>
		</div>
			<h3>Introduction</h3>
			<p>Your team is responsible for designing and implementing a 
cyclometer, also called a bicycle computer. Pictured below is a typical 
cyclometer.</p>
			<p align="center"><img src="Cyclometer%20-%20Requirements%20Phase_files/velo5.jpg" alt="" border="0" width="277" height="380"></p>
			<p>The cyclometer uses a magnetic sensor on one of the bicycle's 
wheels to generate a pulse once per wheel revolution. These pulses are 
counted to compute the speed of the bicycle and a number of other  
related quantities.</p>
			<p>This assignment has you defining requirements for this typical cyclometer. You can use the <a href="http://www.se.rit.edu/%7Eswen-462/projects/final%20project/Cyclometer/velo5-manual.pdf">instruction manual for the cyclometer pictured above</a> to help you identify the use cases for a generic cyclometer. <img src="Cyclometer%20-%20Requirements%20Phase_files/new.htm" alt="New" width="32" height="16"><span class="NewText">Use the Velo 5 feature set with the addtion of the calculation of elapsed time and average speed.</span>
 (Note: when you begin the design and implementation phase of this 
project, you will receive a set of requirements, which will ensure  that
 all teams   work to the same requirements.) Based on the use cases that
 you identify, define a consistent set of well-formed requirements 
statements that cover all the features in this cyclometer. Keep alert to
 capture any structure that exists in the requirements by having a 
hierarchy of requirements. Most requirements statements will be of the 
form: "The cyclometer shall ..."</p>
<h3>Requirements Analysis</h3>
			<p>Analyze the requirements for this cyclometer. This analysis should include activities which:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Identify actors external to the system.</li>
              <li>Identify use cases providing: name, goal of the use case, actor trigerring the use case</li>
              <li>Show the interaction of actors and use cases via a Use Case diagram</li>
              <li>Create a set of unambiguous "The cyclometer shall ..." style requirements statements for the cyclometer's features.</li>
              <li>Identify and characterize events that the system must 
handle, i.e. ones that cross the system boundary. Your event 
characterization should include: event name, what the event represents, 
actor initiating or receiving the event, timing characteristics, effect 
of event on the system or the actor receiving it.</li>
            </ul>
<p>Consider the boundary for your system to be the microcontroller and 
its memory in the cyclometer. From the microcontroller's perspective, 
hardware elements that the microcontroller interfaces with are external 
actors, i.e. the bicyclist is not an actor.</p>
<h3>Timing Constraints Analysis</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>Specify the range of non-zero speeds that the cyclometer will display.</li>
              <li>Given that range of speeds, specify the timing 
constraints for performing the calculation of bicycle speed. Assume that
 the circumfirence of the wheel which holds the magnetic sensor is 
between 190 and 220 cm.</li>
              <li>Describe how you will compute the bicycle's current 
speed including how often the calculations will be performed, how oftern
 the displayed values will be updated, and any filtering or averaging 
you will do on the calculations.</li>
              <li>Describe how you will compute the bicycle's average speed including <img src="Cyclometer%20-%20Requirements%20Phase_files/new.htm" alt="New" width="32" height="16"><span class="RemoveText">handling manually</span> <span class="NewText">automatically</span> turning the calculation on and off.</li>
              <li>Describe how you will detect that the bicycle has stopped.</li>
              <li>Specify how fast  you will scan the inputs (buttons, magnetic sensor) to your cyclometer. How did you determine those rates?</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Submission Instructions</h3>
	<p>For this assignment, you will submit two files</p>
            <ul>
              <li>A  document which contains the artifacts for your 
requirements and timing constraints analyses along with a discussion of 
all elements of the analyses. Submit this as either a Word or PDF file.</li>
              <li>An Excel spreadsheet, which has data for, at least, 10 test points for checking the speed calculation. </li>
            </ul>
            <p>Submit these items in the myCourses dropbox before the date and time when the dropbox closes.</p>
